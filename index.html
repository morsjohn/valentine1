    <!-- Portrait Section (Originally in body) -->
    <div id="portrait-section">
        <p>Today I choose to speak life over myself. I choose to believe that I am created with purpose, designed
            with intention, and filled with potential beyond what I can see right now. I am not an accident. I am
            not a mistake. Every part of my story, every chapter, every lesson has shaped me into who I am becoming.
            I may not be perfect, but I am growing, and growth is beautiful.</p>

        <p>I affirm that I am worthy of love. Real love. Patient love. Honest love. I deserve respect, kindness, and
            understanding. I deserve relationships that build me, not break me. I deserve to be chosen, not
            tolerated. I deserve someone who sees my value even on the days when I struggle to see it myself.</p>

        <p>I am strong, even when I feel weak. Strength is not the absence of struggle; it is the decision to keep
            going despite it. I have survived days I once thought I couldn’t. I have faced challenges that tested my
            faith, my patience, and my courage — and I am still here. That alone is proof of my resilience.</p>

        <p>I affirm that my dreams matter. The visions in my heart were placed there for a reason. I will not shrink
            myself to fit into spaces that cannot contain my calling. I will not silence my voice to make others
            comfortable. I will rise, step by step, even if the progress feels slow. Progress is still progress.</p>

        <p>I am learning to forgive myself for the times I doubted my worth. I release the mistakes of my past. I
            release the guilt that no longer serves me. I release the fear of not being enough. I am enough. Right
            now. As I am.</p>

        <p>I choose peace over overthinking. I choose faith over fear. I choose hope over despair. My mind does not
            control me — I control my thoughts. When negative voices whisper lies, I will answer with truth. When
            doubt tries to settle in my heart, I will remind myself of everything I have already overcome.</p>

        <p>I affirm that I am becoming wiser each day. Every experience teaches me something valuable. Even the
            painful lessons carry hidden blessings. I trust that what did not work out was protecting me from
            something not meant for me. I trust that what is meant for me will never miss me.</p>

        <p>Love flows to me freely and abundantly. I am surrounded by people who care about my well-being. I attract
            healthy connections. I attract opportunities aligned with my purpose. I attract joy, creativity, and
            success into my life.</p>

        <p>I affirm that my efforts are not wasted. Even when no one sees the late nights, the silent prayers, the
            hidden tears — they matter. My consistency matters. My dedication matters. The seeds I plant today will
            bloom in the right season.</p>

        <p>I allow myself to rest without guilt. Rest is not laziness; it is restoration. I deserve moments of
            stillness. I deserve time to breathe. I deserve to enjoy life without constantly proving my worth.</p>

        <p>I affirm that my future is bright. The best chapters of my story are still being written. Doors will open
            at the right time. Opportunities will align. The right people will enter my life and stay. I am walking
            toward something greater than I can imagine.</p>

        <p>I am grateful for who I am becoming. I am grateful for lessons that shaped my character. I am grateful
            for strength I didn’t know I had. Gratitude shifts my focus from what I lack to what I already possess.
        </p>

        <p>I affirm that I am capable. Capable of love. Capable of success. Capable of leadership. Capable of
            growth. I am capable of building the life I pray for. I will not let fear stop me from trying.</p>

        <p>My heart is open to receive blessings. My mind is open to new ideas. My hands are ready to work for what
            I believe in. I trust the timing of my life. I trust that delays are not denials. I trust that every
            setback is setting me up for something better.</p>

        <p>I affirm that I am not defined by rejection. I am not defined by failure. I am not defined by criticism.
            I am defined by my courage to rise again. I am defined by my character. I am defined by my faith.</p>

        <p>Today, I choose to love myself more intentionally. I will speak kindly to myself. I will celebrate small
            wins. I will forgive my imperfections. I will appreciate my uniqueness.</p>

        <p>I affirm that I bring value wherever I go. My presence makes a difference. My words can encourage. My
            actions can inspire. I may not always see the impact, but it is there.</p>

        <p>I am becoming more confident every day. Confidence grows when I show up consistently. Confidence grows
            when I step outside my comfort zone. Confidence grows when I believe that I deserve to take up space.
        </p>

        <p>I affirm that I am deeply loved — by God, by those who truly know me, and by the future version of myself
            who is proud I didn’t give up.</p>

        <p>No matter what today brings, I will face it with courage. No matter what tomorrow holds, I will meet it
            with faith. I am walking forward, not backward. I am moving upward, not downward.</p>

        <p>I am blessed. I am guided. I am protected. I am growing.</p>

        <p>And I will continue to rise.</p>
